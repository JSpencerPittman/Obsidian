### Volume of the unit ball
While most of the volume is contained in the annulus of the unit sphere
We also see that as dimensions rise to infinity the volume of the sphere approaches 0

Surface area of unit sphere:
$$\Large A(d)=\frac{2\pi^{\frac{d}2}}{\Gamma(\frac{d}2)}$$
And the volume of the unit sphere is (remember $V(d)=\frac{A(d)}d$): 
$$\Large V(d)=\frac{2\pi^{\frac{d}2}}{d\Gamma(\frac{d}2)}$$
The volume of the sphere goes to zero as dimensions rise because while $\pi^{\frac{d}2}$ grows exponential $\Gamma(\frac{d}2)$ grows factorially.
$$
\Large\underset{d\rightarrow\infty}{lim}V(d)=0
$$
### Volume near the Equator
For $c\geq1$ and $d\geq3$, at least a $1-\frac{2}ce^{-c^2/2}$ fraction of the volume of the d-dimensional unit ball has $|x_1|\leq\frac{c}{\sqrt{d-1}}$

This can better explained by the following
$$\Large\frac{volume(A)}{volume(H)}\leq\frac{\text{upper bound volume}(A)}{\text{lower bound volume}(H)}=\frac{2}ce^{-\frac{c^2}2}$$
> Here A is the volume of the unit sphere where $x_1 \geq \frac{c}{\sqrt{d-1}}$
> Here H is the upper hemisphere

The volume of A can be described as 
$$\Large volume(A)=\int_{\frac{c}{\sqrt{d-1}}}^1(1-x_1^2)^{\frac{d-1}{2}}V(d-1)dx_1$$
The chance of a new unit vector being above $O(1/\sqrt{d})$ for $x_1$ is extremly low making it very close to orthogonal, and also most will lie in $1-O(1/d)$ given the fact that most points lie in the annulus.
