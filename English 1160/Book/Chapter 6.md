## Engaging Sources Actively
Activley read your sources, if you can read it twice. Don't look for disagreements the first time but read in a way the source makes sense. Resist the temptation to disagree. 

Think not only about what it says but also how you would respond. Record those responses in your notes. Check your understanding by summarizing: if you can't do this you don't understand enough to disagree.

Don't take "Authority" for granted, experts disagree all the time. 

## Reading for a problem
Use your problem to search for papers to respond to. But of course read for a problem so you know what to search for. 

**Creative Agreement**
If you agree with a source think what new cases might it cover? What new insights can it provide? Is there confirming evidence the source hasn't considered.
1. Offer Additional Support
2. Confirm Unsupported Claims
3. Apply a claim more widely

**Creative DIsagreement**
1. Contradictions of kind
	A source says something is of one kind of thing but it's another
2. Part-Whole Contradictions
	Mistaking the parts of something to be related
3. Development of Historical Contradictions
4. External cause-effect contradictions
	Mistakes a causal relationship
5. Contradictions of perspective
	Contradict a standard view of things, urging others to think in a new way

## Reading for arguments
### Read for arguments to respond to
A paper is made stronger by aknowledging opposing views
It helps to understand why a rational person may think differently and be shown a justification to that.

### Read models for reasoning and analysis
Just make sure to lend some credit
You reasoning doesn't have to be unique that's what your claim and problem is for

## Reading Data and Support
Don't just cite a researcher agrees, cite why the researcher would agree. 
Use statistical data if you can judge for yourself how they got their answers.

## Taking Notes
Bibliographical information
Separate notes on different topics, even if from the same source
Make sure your notes are accurate
Clearly distinguish what you quote from a source, what you paraphrase or soummarize from a source, and your own thoughts. 

Summarize: Need the point of a passage. Useful for context or views that are related but not specifically relevant. A summary never serves as good evidence.

Paraphrase: When the specific words of a passage aren't important as their meaning. A paraphrase is never as good as a direct quotatation.
Quotations: Quoted words are evidence that backs up your reasons, from an authority you will 
	rely on or challenge, strikingly original or so compelling that the quotation can frame the rest of your discussion, the source makes a claim you disagree with

Ensure the context is right
Don't record everything but record enough to ensure that you accuratley capture the source's meaning. No just what they say but how they use the information.
1. When summ, para, or quoting be careful about context
	Get the authors reasoning established to justify a conclusion you may want to use.
2. When you record a claim note its role in the original
	Main point? Minor point? A qualification or concession? 
3. Record the scope and confidence of a claim
4. Don't mistake a summary of another writer's views for those of an author summarizing them. 
5. Note why sources agree and disagree
