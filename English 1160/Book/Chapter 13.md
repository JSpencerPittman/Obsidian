# Organizing your argument
The first draft is usually to discover what they can actually make for their point and whether it holds up to their own scrutiny. To write a paper for readers you must know what readers are looking for in a paper. Then determine if your draft helps them find it. 

## 13.1 Thinking like a reader
Readers aren't bead by bead readers, they want an 
- idea of the whole, 
- its structure,
- most importantly why they should be reading it in the first place. 

They then use this sense of the whole and its aims to interpret its parts. 
Attend to overall organization, then sections, coherence of your paragraphs and clarity of your sentences, and only then spelling and punctuation. 

Often its best to revise top to bottom. 

## 13.2 Revising your Frame
Readers must identify three things instantly
- Where intro ends
- Where conclusion begins
- What sentence in one or both states your main point

To fulfill this do the following
1. Put an extra space after your introduction and before your conclusion
2. State your main point at or close to the end of your introduction.
	- Should be similar but not identical to conclusions point, conclusion's is more specifc and contestable
3. Include in the point sentences of your introduction key terms that name concepts and themes that run through your paper. 

## 13.3 Revising your Argument
#### Identify the Substance of your Argument
Does the structure of your argument match the structure of your paper?
1. Is each reason supporting your main claim the point of a section of its own?
2. Do you strick the right balance between reasons and evidence?

#### Evaluate the quality of your Argument
1. Is your evidence reliable?
2. Have you appropriately qualified your argument?
	- Drop in hedging words
3. Does your paper read like a conversation with peers or colleagues ashing hard but friendly questions? 
4. Have you expressed all the warrants you should?

## 13.4 Revising the organization of your paper
1. Do the key terms run through the whole paper?
2. Is the beginning of each section and subsection clearly signaled?
3. Does each major section begin with words that signal how that section relates to the one before it?
4. Is it clear how each section relates to the whole?
5. Is the point of each section stated in a brief introduction (preferably) or in its conclusion?
6. Do terms that unify each section run through it?

## 13.5 Checking your paragraphs
## 13.6 Letting your draft cool, then paraphrasing it
