# Making Good Arguments
## 7.1 Argument as conversation with readers
In a research argument you make a *claim*, 
back it with *reasons* supported by *evidence*,
*acknowledge* and *respond* to other views,
and sometimes explain your *principles* of reasoning

1. Claim: What do you want me to believe? What's your point?
2. Reasons: Why do you say that? Why should I agree?
3. Evidence: How do you know? Can you back it up?
4. Acknowledgement and Response: By what about...?
5. Warrant: How does that follow? What's your logic? Can you explain your reasoning?

## 7.2 Supporting your claim
### Support claims with Reasons
A reasons is a statement that leads readers to accept your claim. Can be conjoined to a claim with *because*
### Base reasons on evidence
Data is your evidence. Our mind finds the reasons and our work finds the evidence. 

## 7.3 Aknowledging and Responding to Anticipated Questions and Objects
Careful readers will question every part of your argument. Anticipate these questions as much as possible. Acknowledge the most important ones.

## 7.4 Connecting Claims and Reasons with warrants
Even when a reader agree that a reason is true, they may still object that it's not relevant to your claim.  To resolve this you must provide a *general principle* that justifies relating your *particular* reason to your *particular* claim. The logic of this is if a Generalization is true wouldn't its specifics be as well. 

For this logic to work the reader must agree with four things:
1. The warrant is true or reasonable
2. The reason is true or reasonable
3. The specific circumstance in the reason qualifies as a plausible instance of the general circumstance in the warrant
4. The specific consequence in the claim qualifies as a plausible instance of the general consequence in the warrant

Warrants are typically ised when the author thinks that readers in their fields might ask how a reason is relevant to a claim or when they are explaining their fields ways of reasoning to general readers. 

Warrant -> Claim -> Reason -> Evidence -> Acknowledgement

## Developing ethos through a thicker arugument
Earns the confidence of the reader through responding to potential problems.
