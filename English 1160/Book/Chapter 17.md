# Revising Style
How to identify sentences that make sense to you?

## Judging Style
Dense, asbtract, opaque, simpleminded.
Often complex writing isn't the irreducible thoughts of a genius but and inconsideration of the audience. 

## The First Two Principles of Clear Writing
Don't explain how you feel about the sentences, connect things such as confusing to what's in a sentence, know how to revise your sentences when they're clear to you but not your readers. 

The principles of complexity of a sentence focus on the first six/seven words of a sentence and the last four or five. The rest of the sentence usally takes care of itself. 

Simple Subject, Whole Subject, Verb, Noun, and clause

**First principle of clear writing**
*"Readers will judge your sentences to be clear and readable to the degree that you make their subjects name the main characters in your story. When you do this, your subjects will be short, specific, and concrete."*

Subjects=Characters and actions=verbs

Verb->Noun : Nominalize

TWO PRINCIPLES:
Express crucial actions in verbs
Make your central character the subjects of those verbs; keep those subjects short, concrete, and specific

### Diagnosis/Revision
1. Underline the first 6/7 words of every clause
2. Perform two tests
	1. Concrete characters as subject, not abstractions
	2. Do underlined verbs name specific actions, not general ones such as have, make, do, be and so on?
3. If it fails one of two revise

### Main characters
Who you want your story to be about

## Third Principle: Old Before New
Readers follow a story best if they can begin each sentence with a character/idea familiar to them. Already mentioned or from context.
If begin with a character or old info choose old.

## Active vs Passive
Passive allows us to move the older more familiar information from the end of its sentences to its beginning. Passibe: build sentences that begin with older information. Active brings a unnecessary person into sights of the reader, bring subjectivity.

Active when only researchers can perform. How they discovered and how they solved it.

## Final Principle: Complexity Last
Familiar first -> complex information last
New technical term, unit of long & complex information
Introduce a concept that you intend to develop
