## Finding a research question
1. Find a topic that is specific enough to let you master a reasonable amount of information on it in the time you have.
2. Question that topic until you find questions that catch your interest.
3. Determine the kind of evidence your readers will expect you to offer in support of your answer. Primary of secondary work. Quantitative or quotations from authorities, or firsthand observations. 
4. Can you obtain this evidence? There's no point researching a topic unless you have a good chance of finding the right kind of evidence.

Data is inert, but once you use it to support a claim it becomes evidence. 

Write a lot, even reflectivley, outlines, why disagree with a source, diagrams for disparate facts, summaries of sources, positions, and schools or even random thoughts.
