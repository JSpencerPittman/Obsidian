# From questions to a problem
## 4.1 Understanding Research Problems
To make you research matter you write it to solve a problem others want to solve. 

**Practical Problems**: What should we do?
A pratical problem is a problem that if ignored means trouble.
Without an obvious solution you have to find a way to solve it. To do this you must pose a different problem, a research problem that's defined by what you do not know or understand about your practical problem. 

Practical Problem: The chain on bike broke
Research Problem: Can I find a bike shop that will replace it?
Research Solution: found bike shop at ---
Practical solution: take bike there to fix it

A practical problem is caused by some condition in the world that troubles us because it's costing us time, money, respect, security, oppurtunity, or even our lives. This problem is solved by *doing* something.

However to know what to do, someone has to understand something better.

**Conceptual Problem**: What should we think?
The need for knowledge and/or understanding raises a conceptual problem. Do not understand something about the universe as much as we'd like. Solved by answering a question that helps us to understand it better. Typically solved through research. 

Pratical Problem - *motivates* -> Research Question - *defines* -> Conceptual/Research Problem - *leads to* -> Research Answer - *helps to solve* -> Practical Problem

A *problem* in research isn't something we avoid but seek out. 

## 4.2 Understanding the common structure of problems
Practical and Conceptual problems both share the same two-part structure
- A situation or condition and
- Undesirable consequences caused by that condition, costs that you don't want to pay (or better) you readers don't want to pay
You must cleary describe both parts of the problem
The significance of a problem is based on the cost the reader pays if you don't solve it

**Ask so what?** in response to your condition and explanation of the cost.
Stop aknowledging a problem and shift to What do we do about it? is when the problem's been accepted. 

The condition of a conceptual problem is some verison of not knowing/understanding
The cost of a conceptual problem is called its consequence. The consequence is a kind of **ignorance** that keeps us from understanding something even more significant. 

For example:
1.I am studying stories of the Alamo, 
2.because I want to understand why voters responded to them in ways that served the interests of local Texas Politicans
3.In order to help readers understand the bigger and more important question **of how regional self-images influence national politics**

**Pure** vs **Applied** research
Pure = Conceptual
Applied = Practical

Test if your potential significance is a bit of a stretch from the research question
If my readers wanted to achieve the goal of ___ would they think that they could do it if they found out ___ ?

If your problem *might* apply to practical research write it as a conceptual problem and add a fourth step of the potential practical applications

## 4.3 Finding a good Research Problem
Ask friends
Look for them in your sources
	Contradictions, Inconsistencies, incomplete explanations
	Last few pages of the research
Look at your own conclusion

## 4.4 Learning to work with problems
Don't ask *can i solve it?* but *will readers think it should be solved?*
