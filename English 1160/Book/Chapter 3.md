# From Topics to Questions
A topic requires focus, without a research paper quickly becomes a sludge of random facts. 
Need to distinguish a topic from a subject. A **subject** is a broad area of knowledge, while a topic is a specific interest within the area.

A topic is an approach to a subject, asks a question whose answer solves a problem the reader cares about. Many questions come from a "mental itch" about a small question that isn't "in the air" but only for a single researcher. Eventually decide if the answer to your problem solves a significant to some community of researchers.

## 3.1 Interest -> Topic
What interests me about this topic, or others?
Explore it's *research potential* 
	Find narrow views you disagree with explore it

## 3.2 Topic -> Focused One
If it can be stated in 4-5 words it's too broad
Use relationship/action verbs to show relationships. lacking these verbs results in a static topic. A nonstatic topic when converted into a claim goes somewhere that a static topic can't. 
Don't narrow your topic down too much.

## 3.3 Focused Topic -> Question
Once they have a focused topic many researched skipping asking a specific question for a specific answer. With no answer it's hard to select from the data on what to use.
Start with the basic *who, what, when, where, but focus on how, and why*. 

Ask about
- History of your topic
	- fit into larger **developmental context**
	- it's own **internal history**
- Structure and composition
	- How does topic fit into **context of a larger structure or function as part of a larger system**
	- How does its parts **fit together as a system**
- How is it categorized
	- How can it be **grouped into kinds**
	- How does the topic **compare to and contrast with** others like it
- Pos questions into neg questions
- Ask what if? and other speculative questions
- Questions from other sources
	- Build on **agreement**
	- Now **disagreement**

Evaulate your questions
	make you think about your topic in a new way

## 3.4 The most significant Question: So What?
Although you don't have to answer this question early on, you need to consider this aspect. This forces you to consider how your work will strike others.

- Step One: Name your topic
	- I am trying/studying/learning of the ...
- Step Two: Add an indirect question
	- Indicate what you do and don't understand about the topic
		- because I want to find out who/what/when/where/whether/why/how
	- This part indicates why you're pursuing the topic
- Step Three: Answer so what? by motivating your question
	- add a second indirect question that explains why you asked your first question
	- say *in order to help my reader understand how, why, or whether*

Summary
1. What are you writing about-I am working on the topic of...
2. What don't you know about it-because I want to find out...
3. Why you want your reader to know and care about it-in order to help my reader understand better...
