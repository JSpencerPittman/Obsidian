- **Summary, research question, how they answered the question, conclusions?**

The source is finding a way inexpensive way to detect drought stress in real time utilizing ml and dl algorithms so that farmers can act quickly to reduced yield loss. They use the absence of leaf wilting during periods of water stress in hand with expert derived visual drought ratings to train said model.
