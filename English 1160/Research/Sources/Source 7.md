- **Summary, research question, how they answered the question, conclusions?**

A problem in Africa is conservation agriculture is hard to adopt without technologies to assist in targeting certain spatial areas with certain practices. ML algorithms have shown great promise in accuratley predicting maize yield. In doing this we can optimize spatial targeting for where to apply sustainable agricultural technologies.
