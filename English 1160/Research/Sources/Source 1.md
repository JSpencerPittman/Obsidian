- **Summary, research question, how they answered the question, conclusions?**

Utilized the Ensemble Empirical Decomposition Method, Method of dependent variable variance decomposition, as well as the sen-slope method they measured the effect of climate change and human activities impact of maize yield over multiple timescales. They found that in the short term climate change was the key factor behind oscillating yields while in the mid to long term human activities carried the greatest impact upon maize yields.
