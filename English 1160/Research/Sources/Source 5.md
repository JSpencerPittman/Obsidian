- **Summary, research question, how they answered the question, conclusions?**

The authors attempted to train a corn classification model that can detect and calculate the area of corn fields from UAV Imagery utilizing Deep learning techniques. By using a balanced database of altitudes, regions, seasons during the data extraction process they improved the performance of their trained systems to classify corn in hard to identify areas.
