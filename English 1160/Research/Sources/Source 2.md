- **Will this source be included in your Problem Statement section, or the Connection to the Field? Why?**

This will also be used in my problem statement section because it shows how badly the corn yield may be impacted in parts of the us and highlights why from a soil water balance perspective

- **Summary, research question, how they answered the question, conclusions?**

The researchers are combining multiple predictive models to explore the effects of climate change on corn yield in central Illinois in 2055. This case study shows that climate adaptation is a highly recommended in order to avoid reduced corn yields and the resulting profit losses in central Illinois as corn yields could reduce very likely by as much as 23-34%.
