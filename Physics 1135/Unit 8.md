# Linear Momentum
**Momentum**
$$\Large\vec p=m\vec v$$
**Newton's Second Law**
is really
$$\LARGE\vec F_{net}=\frac{d\vec p}{dt}$$
While for a constant $m$ it would be $m\vec a$

**Impulse**
Impulse $\vec J$ delivered by force $\vec F$ 
$$\Large\vec J=\int_{t_i}^{t_f}\vec Fdt=\vec F_{avg}\Delta t$$
$$\Large\vec J_{net}=\vec p_f-\vec p_i=\Delta\vec p$$
## System of particles
Linear momentum vector of system
$$\Large\vec P=\sum_n\vec p_n=\sum_nm_n\vec v_n$$
In a system of particles there are two generalization of forces, one being the internal forces between system components and the other being external forces from outside the system.

**Newton's 2'nd Law for Systems**
$$\Large\vec F_{net}=\sum\vec F=\frac{d\vec P}{dt}$$
All the internal vectors are in action reaction pairs the net force is the external forces as the internal forces cancel out.
$$\Large\vec F_{net}=\sum\vec F=\sum\vec F_{ext}=\frac{d\vec P}{dt}$$
$$\Large\vec J_{net\hspace{0.2 em}ext}=\vec P_f-\vec P_i=\Delta\vec P$$
**If there are no external forces then**
$$\Large\vec F_{ext}=\frac{d\vec P}{dt}=0$$
$$\Large \vec P_f=\vec P_i$$
## Short Collisions
If collisions happens in very short times:
- forces between colliding objects deliver dominating impulse
- Impulse due to external forces is negligible
- Total linear momentum is conserved
- Total mechanical energy is usually not conserved
*Inelastic Collision*
Perfectly inelastic if they stick together post collision
*Elastic Collision*
Mechanical energy is conserved

**Fractional Change of Kinetic Energy**
$$\Large\frac{\Delta K}{K_i}=\frac{K_f}{K_i}-1$$
Inelastic collisions: loss of kinetic energy
Explosion: chemical energy is released and converted to kinetic energy
