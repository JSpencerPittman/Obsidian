### What is a wave?
A wave is a self-propagating disturbance in a medium
The material of the medium is not moved along the wave.
Particles of the medium are momentarily displaced from their equilibrium. 

### Tranverse Wave & Longitudinal Wave
**Tranverse Wave**:
Displacement perpendicular to propagation direction
Wave on a string, water wave

**Longitudinal Wave**
Displacement parallel to propagation direction
(sound)

### Periodic Waves
Only sine waves because all periodic functions can be expressed as a superposition of different sine functions
Fourier Analysis can accomplish this

### Sinusoidal Wave
- Fixed position located at $x=0$
$$\Large y(x)=Asin(kx+\phi)$$
> $k$ is the wave number
> $\lambda$ is the wavelength

$$\Large k=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$$
### Traveling Wave
$$\Large v=\lambda f\text{ (periodic wave)}$$
$$\Large y(x,t)=Asin(kx\pm\omega t+\phi)$$
$$\omega=kv=2\pi f=\frac{2\pi}{T}$$
Use $-\omega$ for $v_x$ = $+v$ 
Use $+\omega$ for $v_x$ = -$v$

### Tranverse Velocity
Velocity of a particle
y-displacement: $y(x,t)=Asin(kx\pm+\phi)$
$$\Large v_y=\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}=\pm A\omega cos(kx\pm\omega t+\phi)\neq v_x$$
### Maximum Transverse Speed
$$\Large v_{y,max}=A\omega$$
### Speed of tranverse wave on string
$$\Large v=\frac{\omega}{k}=\sqrt\frac{F_t}{\mu}$$
> $F_T$ tension in the string
> $\mu$ linear mass density per unit length

CAUTION: speed of a tranverse wave $\neq$ tranverse speed

### Doppler Effect
Source emits $f_s$ and observer hears at $f_o$ 
> v Speed of waves in the medium
> 
$$
\Large f_o'(x)=\frac{v-v_{ox}}{v-v_{sx}}f_s
$$

### Beats
If two waves traveling in the same direction have frequencies $f_1$ and $f_2$ very close to one another they will produce beats in amplitude with a frequnecy equal to their frequency difference 
$$\Large f_{Beat}=|f_1-f_2|$$
The combined sound warbles the frequency
