### Zero-th Law of Thermodynamics
If two-objects are in thermal contact, no interaction with the enironment $\rightarrow$ will reach the same temperature after sufficent time
**Thermal Equilibrium**

If two objects are in thermal equilibrium with a third object, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other

Basis for any temperature measurement

### Energy Transfer
If two objects are in contact: energy transfer occurs
Heat energy transferred because of difference in temperature.
Heat is always flowing from hot to cold objects
If heat is put into an object, its temperature rises

$$\Large\Delta T=\frac{Q}{mc_{substance}}$$
> Here, $c_{substance}$ is called the specific heat, heat capacity

### Heat
$$\Large Q=mc\Delta T$$
$Q$ is the amount of heat energy that needs to be transferred into mass $m$ of the substance to change its temperature by $\Delta T$. 

If $Q$ is positive:
- $\Delta T$ is positive (temperature increases)
- Heat energy flows into system

If $Q$ is negative:
- $\Delta T$ is negative (temperature decreases)
- Heat energy flows out of the system

### Heat in phase changes
phase changes (phase transitions) require (+) or release (-) extra amount of heat

$Q=\pm mL_f$ for Liquid
$Q=\pm mL_v$ for gas
> $L_f$ is latent heat of fusion
> $L_v$ is latent heat of vaporization


Member $Q_a+Q_b=0$
Member $Q_a+Q_b+Q_{phase}=0$

### Heat Conduction
Conduction - Two objects in direct contact with each other
Convection - Fluid dynamics
Radiation     - Energy transferred through electromagnetic 
	waves

If we have an object of length $L$ and cross sectional area $A$ and temperatures $T_{hot}$ and $T_{cold}$ at ends

Rate of heat energy flow through area $A$ in *steady state*:
$$\Large H=\frac{dQ}{dt}=kA\frac{T_{hot}-T_{cold}}{L}$$
> $k$ is the thermal conductivity

### Material Boundaries
In steady state the heat flow rate throughout the object is constant

Layers of different materials with different thermal conductivities $k_n$ and thickness $L_n$ 

$$\Large R_{tot}=\sum R_n\hspace{2 em}R_n=\frac{R_n}{k_n}$$
Making
$$\Large H=A\frac{T_{hot}-T_{cold}}{R_{tot}}$$
Steady State: $H_1=H_2$
