Two waves traveling in opposite directions with:
- Same amplitude
- Same wavelength $\lambda$ (and thus same $k$)
- Same frequency $f$ (and thus same $\omega$)

Same speed because $v = \lambda f$

$$\Large\begin{align}
y_1(x,t)&=A_0sin(kx-\omega t)\\
y_2(x,t)&=A_0sin(kx+wt)
\end{align}$$
Given that
$$\Large sin(a)+sin(b)=2sin(\frac{a+b}{2})cos(\frac{a-b}{2})$$
We can show that 
$$\Large y(x,t)=y_1+y_2=2Asin(kx)cos(\omega t)$$

## Standing wave on a string
A string of length $L$ with fixed ends on both sides has the boundary conditions:
$$\Large\begin{align}y(x=0,t)&=0\\y(x=L,t)&=0\end{align}$$
Hence $sin(kL)=0$ and $kL=n\pi$ 

Because $k=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ we can see that $\lambda=\frac{2L}n$
Because $v=f\lambda$ we can see that $f=\frac{nv}{2L}$

**What waves satisfy these conditions?**
- $n=1$, fundamental, first harmonic
	- $\lambda = 2L$, $f=\frac{v}{2L}$
- $n=2$, 1st overtone, second harmonic
	- $\lambda = L$, $f=\frac{v}{L}$
- $n=3$, 2nd overtone, third harmonic
	- $\lambda = \frac{2}{3}L$, $f=\frac{3v}{2L}$

### Sound produced by standing wave
Remember it has the same frequency as the standing wave but the velocity will be the speed of sound

### Interference
When two or more traveling waves superimose, this is interference
Constructive: amplitudes add
Destructive: amplitudes negate

### Interference and path length
Two sources, waves emitted in phase--Released at same moment. How do they combine at point $p$. 

If crests of both waves arrive at the same time we observe **constructive** interference integer $n$ 
$$\Large|L_1-L_2|=\Delta L=n\lambda$$
If crest of wave 1 arrives at the same time as trough of wave 2 we observe **destructive** interference 
$$\Large|L_1-L_2|=\Delta L=(n+\frac{1}2)\lambda$$
