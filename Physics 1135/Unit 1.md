## 1.1 The Nature of Physics
Physics can be describe as the *process* by which we arrive at general principles that describe how the physical universe behaves

Prove a theory false through contradiction but never to be true.

**Range of Validity** is a quality of theories or ideas that only work under certain circumstances, so new developments extend this range in physics

## 1.2 Solving Physics Problems
To truly understand a concept means being able to apply it to a variety of problems

### Problem Solving Strat 1.1
- **Identify** the relevant concepts
	- Identify target variables
	- Known Quantities
- **Set Up** the problem
	- Choose the equations to use to solve the problem
	- Sketch the problem
	- Estimate the answer
- **Execute** the solution
	- Do the math
- **Evaluate** your answer
	- Compare answer with your estimate
	- If algebraic expression assure that it works in the extreme cases

**Model** simplified version of a situation in physics

## 1.3 Standards and Units
**Physical Quantity** is a number used to describe a physical phenomenon
**Operational Definition** can be measured and not based off of other variables
**Unit** the standard to which we measure things

$10^{-9}$ nano, $10^{-6}$ micro, $10^{-3}$ milli

## 1.4/5 Unit Consistency and Sig Figs
An equation must be **dimensionally consistent**, must have same units to be added

Distinction between to measurements of different calipers is their **uncertainty**
**error** is also called uncertainty
$1.6454(21) = 1.6454 \pm 0.0021$
$56.47 \pm 0.02 = 56.47 \pm 0.04\%$

The uncertaintiy of a number is it's last digit
137 km = 1 km of uncertainty

Sig figs of a $\times \text{ or } \div$ can only be as many as the fewest factor
While in $+ \text{ or } -$ it's the location of the shortest sig fig that matters

**Scientific Notation** = **Powers of 10 notation**

**fractiona/percent error** is percentage that it's off

## 1.7 Vectors and Vector Addition
**Antiparallel** if the go in opposite directions

## 1.8 Components of Vectors
Components of a vector
$$\LARGE \overrightarrow{A} = \overrightarrow{A}_x + \overrightarrow{A}_y$$
Magnitiude of a vector
$$\LARGE A = \sqrt{A_x^2 + A^2_y}$$
## 1.9 Unit Vectors
**Unit vector** is a vector with a magnitude of 1
$$\LARGE \overrightarrow{A} = A_x\hat{i} + A_y\hat{j} + A_z\hat{k}$$


## 1.10 Product of Vectors
**Scalar Product** of two vectors $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$ is denoted by $\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}$. 
$\phi$ is the angle between them conjoined at the tail. $0\leq\phi\leq 180$
$$\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}=ABcos\phi \text{ (Definition of the scalar (dot) product)}$$
$$\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}=A_XB_X+A_yB_y+A_zB_z \text{ (scalar (dot) product in terms of components)}$$

**Vector Product** of two vectors $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$ is also called the **cross product**.
$$C=ABsin\phi \text{ (magnitude of the vector (cross) product of $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$)}$$
$$\vec{A}\times\vec{B}=\begin{bmatrix}
\hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k}\\ 
A_x & A_y & A_z\\ 
B_x & B_y & B_z 
\end{bmatrix} =\begin{bmatrix} A_y & A_z \\ B_y & B_z\end{bmatrix}\hat{i} - \begin{bmatrix} A_x & A_z \\ B_x & B_z\end{bmatrix}\hat{j} + \begin{bmatrix} A_x & A_y \\ B_x & B_y\end{bmatrix}\hat{k}$$
$$\LARGE\begin{align}
C_x&=A_yB_z-A_zB_y\\
C_y&=A_zB_x-A_xB_z\\
C_z&=A_xB_y-A_yB_x
\end{align}$$
