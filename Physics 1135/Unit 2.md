## 2.1 Displacement, Time, and Average Velocity
**Particle = Point**
$\LARGE v_{av-x} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$
Average Velocity in the x-directions

## 2.2 Instantaneous Velocity
Instantenous Velocity is the velocity at a certain point in time
Instantaneous X-Velocity
$$ v_x = \underset{t\rightarrow0}{lim}\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}=\frac{dx}{dt}$$
## 2.3 Average/Instantaneous Acceleration
Average & Instantaneous Acceleration
$$\begin{align}\LARGE
a_{av-x} &= \frac{\Delta v_x}{\Delta t} \\
\LARGE a_x &= \underset{t\rightarrow0}{lim}\frac{\Delta v_x}{\Delta t} = \frac{dv_x}{dt}
\end{align}$$
## 2.4 Motion with Constant Acceleration
If acceleration is constant then $a_x = \overline{a}_x$ and
$$\LARGE {v}_x = v_{0x} + a_xt$$ 
$\overline{v}_x = \frac{v_{0x} + v_x}{2}$
$\overline{v}_x = v_{0x} + \frac{1}{2}a_xt$
$$\LARGE \Delta x = v_{0x}t + \frac{1}{2}a_xt^2$$
(Constant acceleration only)
$$\LARGE v^2_x = v^2_{0x} + 2a_x\Delta x$$
$$\LARGE \Delta x=(\frac{v_{0x} + v_x}{2})t$$
## 2.5 Freely Falling Bodies
If the effects of air resistance is neglected the acceleration downwards is indeed constant. In addition if the distance of the fall with respect to earth's radius and we ignore the effects of earth's rotation then we have an idealized motion noted as free fall.
$g = 9.8$ meters per second squared

## 2.6 Velocity & Position by integration
$$\begin{align}
\LARGE v_x&=\LARGE v_{0x}+\int_0^ta_xdt \\
\LARGE x&=\LARGE x_0 + \int_0^tv_xdt 
\end{align}$$
