# 4 Newton's Laws of motion
## 4.1 Force and Interactions
In everyday language a force is a push or pull, or better said as an interaction between two bodies or a body and its environment. 

**Contact Force** is direct contact between two bodies
**Normal Force** is the force exerted on anything it's in contact with. Acts perpendicular to the surface of contact. 
**Friction Force** exerted on an object by a surface acts parallel to the surface in the direction opposing sliding. 
**Tension Force** is the pulling force exerted by a rope or cord on an attached object.

**Long-range forces** that act even when bodies are seperated by empty space.
**Weight** is the gravitational force exerted on a body

**Spring Balance** is used to measure forces

The effect of opposing forces is as if a singular force were acting on it such as
$$\vec{R} = \vec{F}_1 + \vec{F}_2+\cdots = \sum\vec{F}$$
AKA **Superposition of forces**
$\sum\vec{F}$ is thought of as the *vector sum of forces*
$$R_x = \sum F_x, \hspace{0.25 em}R_y = \sum F_y$$

## 4.2 Newton's First Law
A body acted on by no net force moves with constant velocity and zero acceleration

**Inertia** tendency of a body to keep moving once it's set in motion. The tendency of a body at rest to remain in rest is also called inertia. 

Body in equilibrium: $\sum\vec{F} = 0$

**Inertial Frame of reference** is a frame of reference in which newton's first law is valid. 

## 4.3 Newton's Second Law
The velocity of the puck is changing at a constant rate
A net force acting on a body causes the body to accelerate in the direction of the net force
Magnitude of acceleration is directly proportional to the force acting on the body

The ratio of the magnitude of the force to the net force of the magnitude of acceleration is referred to as the **inertial mass** 
$$\begin{vmatrix}
\sum\vec{F}
\end{vmatrix} \propto |\vec{a}|$$
$$\begin{vmatrix}
\sum\vec{F}
\end{vmatrix} = ma$$
One newton is the amount of net force that gives an acceleration of 1 meter per second squared to a body with a mass of 1 kilogram. 

If a net external force acts on a body, the body accelerates. The direction of acceleration is the same as the direction of the net force. The mass of the body times the acceleration of the body equals the net force vector. 
$$\sum\vec{F} = ma$$
$$\sum F_x = ma_x$$
## 4.4 Mass and Weight
$w = mg, \hspace{0.25 em} \vec{w} = m\vec{g}$
Mass related to gravitational interactions is referred to as **gravitational mass**. **Inertial mass** as referred to by newton's second law. 

## 4.5 Newton's Third Law
A force acting on a body is always the result of its interaction with another body. Forces come in pairs. These two forces are always equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

*If body A exerts a force on body B('action'), then body B exerts a force on body A('reaction')*. These two forces have the same magnitude but are opposite in direction. These two forces act on different bodies. 

$$\LARGE\vec{F}_{A on B} = -\vec{F}_{BonA}$$


## 4.6 Free-Body Diagrams
Three techniques
1. Newton's first and second laws apply to a specific body. Which body are they acting on? Equilibrium or not?
2. Only forces acting on the body matter. Not the force acted on the environment by the body. 
3. Free-Body diagrams are essential to help identify the relevant forces. A **free-body diagram** is one in which the chosen body is shown and vectors showing the magnitudes and directions of its surroundings. 

If multiple bodies draw each one separately.
