### Conditions for Static Equilibrium
No linear acceleration $$\sum\vec F=0$$No angular acceleration
$$\sum\vec\tau = 0$$
We don't want rotation or translation

### For two dimensional problems it goes
$$\sum F_x=0,\hspace{0.5 em}\sum F_y=0,\hspace{0.5 em},\sum \tau_z=0$$
### Choice of reference point for torques
If the object isn't rotating we can choose any point about which to calculate torques

Reference point along the line of action of a force:
moment arm is zero->no torque

Convenient choices:
point where several forces act
Point where unknown forces act
