### Unscrewing a bolt
To unscrew a bolt three components are essential
- An applied force
- Over a distance
- Perpendicular to the bolt

Just like how the dot product can measure the force applied in the direction of something
The dot product measures the force applied in the direction perpendicular to something

### Vector Cross Product: magnitude
$$\Large\vec A\times\vec{B}=\vec C$$
Magnitude of this cross product C
$$\Large C=ABsin\theta=A_{\perp B}B=AB_{\perp A}$$
C is perpendicular to both A and B with a direction found using the right hand rule, thumb in direction in first
Thumb X Index = Middle Finger

### Torque
$$\Large\vec\tau=\vec r\times\vec F$$
$$\Large|\vec\tau|=rFsin\theta=r_{\perp}F = rF_{\perp}$$

> $\vec r$ is the vector that points from reference to location of force, typically reference is point of rotation

If you use your right hand thumb and curl your fingers in the direction of motion that's your torque is your thumb

$$\Large \tau_z=+rFsin\theta\text{ or }-rFsin\theta$$
### Torque and angular acceleration
Rigid object that can rotate about z-axis
$$\Large\sum\tau_z=I_z\alpha_z$$
> I_z is the moment of interia about the z-axis

Begin with an extened free-body diagram that shows forces and where they act on the object

Make sure positive motion corresponds with positive rotation

### Translation vs Rotation
Linear momentum $\vec p$ is fundamental quantity for translation.
Forces chane linear momentum.

Angular momentum $\vec l$ is fundamental quantity for rotation.
Torques change the angular momentum.
$$\Large \vec l=\vec r\times\vec p=\vec r\times m\vec v$$
$$\Large\vec l=r_\perp mv=rmv_\perp=rmv\hspace{0.2 em}sin\theta$$
R is thumb, p index and l is middle finger

### Angular Momentum of rigid object
For a system of particles
$$\large\vec L=\sum_n\vec l_n$$
$$\Large\vec L=\sum_nr_{\perp n}m_nv_n=\sum_nr_{\perp n}m_n\omega_nr_{\perp n}=\omega\sum_nr_{\perp n}^2m_n$$
$$\Large\vec L=I\vec\omega$$
$\vec L$ is in the same direction as angular velocity $\vec\omega$ vector for rotations about a symmetry axis only. Other axis is not the case.

### Angular Momentum Conservation
$$\Large\sum\tau_z=\frac{dL_z}{dt}=\frac{dI\omega_z}{dt}=I\alpha_z$$
For a system internal torques cancel each other out in action-reaction pairs hence
$$\Large\sum\vec\tau=\sum\vec\tau_{ext}=\frac{d\vec L}{dt}$$
If there are no external torques
$$\Large\sum\vec\tau_{ext}=0\rightarrow\frac{D\vec L}{dt}=0,\hspace{0.25 em}\vec L_i=\vec L_f$$
