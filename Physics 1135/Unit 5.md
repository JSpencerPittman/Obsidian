## 5.3 Friction
When a body rests on a surface the contact force can be considered as one force with it's parallel force being friction and perpendicular force beign friction

The friction acting on a sliding body is **kinetic friction force** $\vec{f}_k$. The magnitude of the kinetic friction force usually increases when the normal force increases. The proportionality of the magnitude of the kinetic friction force and magnitude of normal force is best represented by
$$\LARGE f_k = \mu_kn\text{ (magnitude of kinetic friction force)}$$
Here $\mu_k$ is referred to as the **coefficient of kinetic friction**. The more slippery the surface the smaller $\mu_k$ is. 

When there is no relative motion then the force of friction is considered the **static friction force** $\vec{f}_s$. 
Static Friction Force Cases:
	Object at rest:
		$\LARGE f_s = 0$
	Weak applied force but object remains at rest
		$\LARGE f_s < \mu_sn$
	Stronger applied force but object is just about to slide
		$\LARGE f_s = \mu_sn$
	Box is moving
		$\LARGE f_k = \mu_kn$

$$
\LARGE f_s \leq \mu_sn\text{ (magnitude of static friction force)}
$$
You often have to use the condition that $\sum\vec{F} = 0$ to find $f_s$. 

### Rolling Friction
For things that roll we use a **coefficent of rolling friction** $\mu_r$. 

### Fluid Resistance and Terminal Speed
**Fluid Resistance** is the force that a fluid (a gas or liquid) exerts on a body moving through it. The body exerts a force on the fluid to move it out of the way. The direction of the fluid resistance is always opposite the direction of the body's velocity relative to the fluid. The magnitude of the fluid resistance usually increases proportionally to the speed of the body moving through it unlike friction. 

For small objects moving at small speeds the magnitude of $f$ of the fluid resistance foce is approximatley proportional to the body's speed $v$
$$\LARGE f=kv\text{ (fluid resistance at a low speed)}$$
For bigger objects moving through air at the speed of a tossed tennis ball or faster, the resistant force is often proportional to $v^2$ instead. It is then called **air drag**. 
$$\LARGE f = Dv^2 \text{ (fluid resistance at a high speed)}$$
An object falling in a fluid does not have a constant acceleration due to the fluid resitance force.  **Terminal velocity** is when a object speeds up fast enough the fluid resistance is equal to the pull of gravity ceasing acceleration. 
$$\LARGE v_t=\frac{mg}{k}\text{ (terminal speed, fluid resistance }f=kv)$$
$$\LARGE v_t=\sqrt\frac{mg}{D}\text{ (terminal speed, fluid resistance }f=Dv^2)$$

## 5.4 Dynamics of circular motion
To make the particle accelerate towards the center the center of the circle the net force $\sum\vec{F}$ must always be directed toward the center of the circle. 

$$\LARGE F_{net}=ma_{rad}=m\frac{v^2}{R}\text{ (uniform circular motion)}$$
