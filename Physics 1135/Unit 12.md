# Static Fluids
An object submerged in a fluid will experience a force acting on a surface
Pressure $p$ = Force Magnitude per Area
$$\LARGE p=\frac{dF}{dA}$$
A Fluid is at rest:
	- at given depth, $p$ is same in all directions
	- force due to pressue is perpendicular to all surfaces

Pressure increases with depth due to weight of column above. 
$$\LARGE p_{below}-p_{above} = \rho gh$$
## *Pascal's Principle*
Pressure applied to a confined fluid increases the pressure throughout the fluid by the same amount.

All points at the same level in a contiguous fluid have the same pressure.
$$\LARGE \Delta p =\frac{F_1}{A_1}=\frac{F_2}{A_2}$$

## Buyoancy and Archimedes' Principle
An object fully or partially submerged in a fluid experiences an upward buoyancy force equal to the weight magnitude of the fluid displaced by the object. 
$$\LARGE B=\rho_{fluid}V_{disp}g$$

### Equations
$$\LARGE p_2-p_1=-\rho g(y_2-y_1)$$
$$\LARGE p=p_0+\rho gh\text{ (pressure in a fluid of uniform density)}$$
