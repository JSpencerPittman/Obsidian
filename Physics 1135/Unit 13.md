# Universal Gravitation
### Kepler's Laws
1) The planets move in elliptical orbits with the sun at one focus of the ellipse
2) A line drawn between the sun and a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time
3) $T^2\sim a^3$ the square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis length
$$\LARGE\frac{T_A^2}{T_B^2}=\frac{a_A^3}{a_B^3}$$
Planet moves faster when its closer to the sun.

### Law of Universal Gravitation
$$\LARGE F_{grav}=\frac{GmM}{r^2}$$
Any two masses feel a attraction to each other
$G=6.67x10^{-11}Nm^2/kg^2$

$$\LARGE g=\frac{GM_{planet}}{R_{planet}^2}$$

Originally we assigned $U=mgy$ for gravitational potiential energy however we have seen the $F_g$ be redefined from $mg$ to a new equation. 
So now the work done by a gravitational force is 
$$\LARGE W_{grav}=\int_{r_1}^{r_2}F_rdr$$
> $F_r$ is the radial component of the gravitational force $\vec F$ that points outward
> 	there fore $F_r$ is negative

$$\LARGE F_r=-\frac{GMm}{r^2}$$
Therefore
$$\LARGE W_{grav}=-GMm\int_{r_1}^{r_2}\frac{dr}{r^2}=\frac{GMm}{r_2}-\frac{GMm}{r_1}$$
$$\LARGE U=-\frac{GMm}{r}\text{ (gravitational potential energy)}$$

$$\LARGE v=\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$$
$$\LARGE T=\frac{2\pi r^{\frac{3}{2}}}{\sqrt{GM}}\text{ (Circular Orbit)}$$

## Lec Sec.2
Gravtitational potential energy is a conservative force
$$\LARGE U_{grav}=-\frac{GMm}{r}$$
If the total mechanical energy is $E < 0$ then its in a bound orbit on the other hand if it's positive it can go as far as possible and move to infinity in a hyperbolic trajectory.

At mechanical energy of 0 it is the critical escape energy

$$\LARGE E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2-\frac{GMm}{r}$$
**Critical Escape Condition**
Barely making it to $r=\infty$ having slowed to speed of zero

**Escape Speed**
Minimum speed an object must have at a distance $R$ from a central mass $M$ if it is to go infinitely far away
$$\LARGE v_{esc}=\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}$$
Energy of satellite in circular orbit
$$\LARGE E=-\frac{GMm}{2R}$$
