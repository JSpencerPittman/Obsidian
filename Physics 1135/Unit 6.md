# Work and Kinetic Energy
## 6.1 Work
$$W=Fs\text{ (constant force in direction of straight line displacement)}$$
> $s$ is the displacement
> $F$ is the constant force

The unit for work is Joules.

If work is applied at and angle $\phi$ to the object moving we only consider the force in the direction of movement and disregard the other. So if a person is pushing with force $f$ at an angle of $\phi$ with respect to the horizontal.
$$
W=Fs\hspace{0.1 em}cos\phi\text{ (constant force, straight-line displacement)}
$$
The above can be rewritten as
$$\LARGE W=\vec{F}\cdot\vec{s}$$
Calculate the net force in the direction of displacement and use this for force

## 6.2 Kinetic Energy and the Work-Energy Theorem
The total work done on a body is related to changes in displacement AND speed. The net work is negative if it oposses displacement. 
$$\LARGE K=\frac{1}{2}mv^2\text{ (definition of kinetic energy)}$$
$$\LARGE W_{tot}=K_2-K_1=\Delta K\text{ (Work-Energy Theorem)}$$
## 6.3 Work and Energy with Varying Forces
### Work done by a varying force in a straight-line motion
$$W=\int_{x_1}^{x_2}F_xdx\text{ (varying x-component of force, straight-line displacement)}$$
$$\LARGE F_x=kx\text{ (Force required to stretch a spring)}$$
> $k$ is called the **force constant** 

$$\LARGE W=\int_0^XF_xdx=\int_0^Xkxdx=\frac{kX^2}{2}$$
### Work-Energy Theorem for Motion along a curve
$$\LARGE W=\int_{P_1}^{P_2}Fcos\phi dl=\int_{P_1}^{P_2}F_{||}dl=\int_{P_1}^{P_2}\vec{F}\cdot\vec{dl}\text{  (work done on a curved path)}$$

>$dl$ is tangent to the curve
>$\phi$ is the angle between $\vec{F}$ and $d\vec{l}$ 

The integral used above is called a line integral. Quick Note the arc length in radians is $s = \theta R$

## 6.4 Power
How quickly work is done
$$\LARGE P_{av}=\frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}\text{ (average power)}$$
$$\LARGE P=\underset{\Delta t\rightarrow0}{lim}\frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}=\frac{dW}{dt}\text{ (instantaneous power)}$$
The unit for power is watts, which is the equivalent of joulers per second. 
1 Horsepower equals 746 watts.
$$P=\vec{F}\cdot\vec{v} \text{ (instantaneous rate at which force $\vec{F}$ does work on a particle)}$$
