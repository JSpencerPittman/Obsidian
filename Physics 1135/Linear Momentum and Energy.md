# Momentum and Energy
## Momentum and Energy in multi-step problems
In a quick collision:
	Total linear momentum is conserved $\vec P_f = \vec P_i$
	Total mechanical energy is usually not conserved $E_f\neq E_i$

Before of after a collision:
	It is dominated by external forces,
	Mechanical energy may be conserved, 
	Or change in mechanical energy can be obtained from
		$E_f-E_i=W_{other}$

Inelastic Collision:
	Deformation, heat generation
Perfectly Inelastic
	Objects stick together after coliision
Elastic
	Mechanical energy is conserved

### Elastic Collisions
Total linear Momentum and Total mechanical energy is conserved

Three Equations:
X-component of momentum
Y-component of momentum
Mechanical Energy

## Center of Mass: Definition
$$\LARGE M_{tot}\vec R_{cm}=\sum_nm_n\vec r_n$$
$$\Large\begin{align}
&X_{cm}=\frac{1}{M_{tot}}\sum_nm_nx_n\\
&Y_{cm}=\frac{1}{M_{tot}}\sum_nm_ny_n
\end{align}$$
## Center of Mass and Momentum
$$\Large
M_{tot}\frac{d\vec r_{cm}}{dt}=M_{tot}\vec v_{cm}=\sum_nm_n\vec v_n=\sum_n\vec p_n=\vec P
$$
$$\Large M_{tot}\frac{d\vec v_{cm}}{dt}=M_{tot}\vec a_{cm}=\frac{d\vec P}{dt}=\sum\vec F$$
$$\Large\sum\vec F_{ext}=M_{tot}\vec a_{cm}$$
This is because the internal forces are in action-reaction forces

Often you can set $\sum\vec F_{ext} = 0$ which makes $\vec a_{cm} = 0$ which makes $\vec v_{cm}$ a constant which means it doesn't change before and after the question.
