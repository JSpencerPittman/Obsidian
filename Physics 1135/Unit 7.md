## 7.1 Gravitational Potential Energy
**Potential Energy** is energy associated with a position. 
**Gravitational Potential Energy** is energy associated with a bodies mass and position.
$$\LARGE W_{grav}=Fs=w(y_1-y_2)=mgy_1-mgy_2$$
$$\LARGE U_{grav}=mgy$$
$$\LARGE W_{grav}=U_{grav,1}-U_{grav,2}=-\Delta U_{grav}$$
### Conservation of Mechanical Energy (Gravitational Forces Only)
$$\LARGE K_1+U_{grav,1}=K_2+U_{grav,2}\text{ (if only gravity does work)}$$
Or
$$\LARGE\frac{1}{2}mv^2_1+mgy_1=\frac{1}{2}mv^2_2+mgy_2$$
Also if only gravity does work.
The sum of $K$ and $U_{grav}$ is the **Total mechanical energy of the system**

If only gravity does work
$$\LARGE E=K+U_{grav}=constant$$
### When forces other than gravity do work
$\vec{F}_{other}$ is the force of other forces besides gravity
$$\LARGE W_{tot}=W_{other}+W_{grav}$$
$$\LARGE K_1+U_{grav,1}+W_{other}=K_2+U_{grav,2}$$
### Gravitational Potential Energy for mottion along a curved path
$$\LARGE\vec{w}\cdot\Delta \vec{s}=-mg\hat{j}\cdot(\Delta x\hat{i}+\Delta y\hat{j})=-mg\Delta y$$
The total work is the force times the total distance y

The equation $$\LARGE W_{grav}=U_{grav,1}-U_{grav,2}$$holds true here as well

## 7.2 Elastic Potential Energy
A body is called *elastic* if it returns to its original shape and size after being deformed. To keep an ideal spring stretched a distance $x$ we must keep it stretched with a constant force $F=kx$ where k is the constant force of the string. 

While gravitational potential energy is a shared property between the earth and a body, while elastic potential energy is stored just in the spring. 

Work done on a spring
$$\LARGE W=\frac{1}{2}kx_2^2-\frac{1}{2}kx_1^2$$
When we stretch a spring we're doing positive work
When we relax a spring we're doing negative work on it

Work done by a spring
$$\LARGE W_{el}=\frac{1}{2}kx^2_1-\frac{1}{2}kx_2^2$$
> el stands for elastic

Elastic Potential Energy
$$\LARGE U_{el}=\frac{1}{2}kx^2$$
Work done by an elastic force
$$\LARGE W_{el}=-\Delta U_{el}$$
If only the elastic force does work then the following equation holds
$$\LARGE K_1+U_{el,1}=K_2+U_{el,2}$$
The Ideal spring is massless in order to prevent it from having kinetic energy. 

Overarching formula
$$\LARGE K_1+U_1+W_{other}=K_2+U_2$$
## 7.3 Conservative and Nonconservative Forces
**Conservative Forces**
Two way conversion of kinetic to potential energy
Such as graviational and the spring force
"Reversible"
Independent of the path of the body and depends only on the starting and end points
Total mechanical energy in the presence of only forces is constant as $E=K+U$ 

**Nonconservative Forces**
Kinetic friction and fluid resistance are called **Dissipative sources**
**Internal energy** is raised with higher temperatures. 
$$\LARGE U_{int}=-W_{other}$$
$$\LARGE\Delta K+\Delta U+\Delta U_{int}=0$$
$$\LARGE\Delta K=W_{net}=W_{conservative}+W_{other}$$
$$\LARGE E = K+U$$
$$\LARGE E_f-E_i=W_{other}$$
Net work done by tension in coupled system is 0

## Relationship between force and potential energy
$$\LARGE U(\vec{r}_B)-U(\vec{r_A})=-W_{A\rightarrow B}=-\int_{\vec{r}_a}^{\vec{r}_B}\vec{F}\cdot d\vec{r}$$
In one dimensions $\vec{F}=F_x(x)\hat{i}$
$$\LARGE\Delta U=-\int F_xdx$$
$$\LARGE F_x=-\frac{\Delta U}{dx}$$
$U$ in three dimensions
$$\LARGE\begin{align}
F_x&=-\frac{\partial U(x,y,z)}{\partial x}\\
F_y&=-\frac{\partial U(x,y,z)}{\partial y}\\
F_z&=-\frac{\partial U(x,y,z)}{\partial z}
\end{align}$$
K is maximum where U is minimum
On a potential energy vs time graph, a minimum is stable
While a maximum is unstable
Equilibrium is when $F_x=\frac{-dU(x)}{dx}=0$
U(x) is a max or minimum
