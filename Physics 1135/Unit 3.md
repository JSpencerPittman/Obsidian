## 3.1 Position and Velocity Vectors
Position Vector
$$\LARGE \vec{r} = x\hat{i} + y\hat{j} + z\hat{k}$$
Average Velocity
$$\LARGE \vec{v}_{av} = \frac{\vec{r}_2-\vec{r}_1}{t_2-t_1} = \frac{\Delta\vec{r}}{\Delta t}$$
Instantaneous Velocity
$$\LARGE \vec{v}=\underset{\Delta t\rightarrow0}{lim}\frac{\Delta\vec{r}}{\Delta t} = \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}$$
Components of instantaneous velocity
$$\begin{align}\LARGE v_x = \frac{dx}{dt}, v_y = \frac{dy}{dt},v_z = \frac{dz}{dt}\\\LARGE \vec{v} = \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}=\frac{dx}{dt}\hat{i}+\frac{dy}{dt}\hat{j}+\frac{dz}{dt}\hat{k}\end{align}$$
Magnitude of velocity
$$\LARGE |\vec{v}| = v = \sqrt{v^2_x + v^2_y+v^2_z}$$
## 3.2 The acceleration vector
Average Acceleration
$$\LARGE \vec{a}_{av} = \frac{\Delta\vec{v}}{\Delta t}$$
Instantenous Velocity
$$\LARGE \vec{a} = \frac{\Delta\vec{v}}{\Delta t}$$

## 3.3 Projectile motion 
**Projectile**, any body that is given an initial velocity and follows a path determined by air resistance and gravity. The path is called **Trajectory**.
$$\begin{align}\LARGE a_x = \frac{dv_x}{dt}, a_y = \frac{dv_y}{dt},a_z = \frac{dv_z}{dt}\\
\LARGE \vec{a} = \frac{dv_x}{dt}\hat{i}+\frac{dv_y}{dt}\hat{j}+\frac{dv_z}{dt}\hat{k}\end{align}$$
## 3.4 Motion in a circle
For an object to move in a circle a component of acceleration must be perpendicular to its path. 

**Uniform Circular Motion** is when a particle moves in a circle with constant speed. 
$$\LARGE a_{rad}=\frac{v^2}{R}\text{ (uniform circular motion)}$$
> $R$ is the radius of the circle

Because the acceleration in uniform circular motion is always directed toward the center of the circle it's called **Centripetal Acceleration**. 

$$\LARGE\begin{align}v&=\frac{2\pi R}{T}\\a_{rad}&=\frac{4\pi^2R}{T^2}\text{ (uniform circular motion)}\end{align}$$
> $T$ is the **period**, which is the time for one revolution. 


If the speed varies as it's going around the circle then its motion is **nonuniform circular motion**. The $a_{rad}$ is greatest in the circle where the speed is the greatest. $a_{ll}$ is the acceleration that is parallel to the objects motion also refered to as $a_{tan}$ due to it being tangent to the circle's surface. 
$$\LARGE a_{rad}=\frac{v^2}{R}\hspace{2 em}a_{tan}=\frac{d|\vec{v}|}{dt}$$


## 3.5 Relative Velocity
The velocity seen by a particular observer is a **relative velocity**. 
The position of P on the x-axis with respect to the frame of reference of A can be represented as $X_{P/A}$
$$\LARGE X_{P/A} = X_{P/B} + X_{B/A}$$
The x-velocity of P relative to frame A is $v_{P/A-x}$
$$\LARGE v_{P/A-x} = v_{P/B-x} + v_{B/A-x}$$
Relative velocity in space
$$\LARGE \vec{v}_{P/A} = \vec{v}_{P/B} + \vec{v}_{B/A}$$
