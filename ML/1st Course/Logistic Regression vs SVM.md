# Logistic Regression vs SVM
If n = Large with respect to M
	Logistic regression or a linear SVM
	$\frac{n}{m} =$ 1000 <-> 10, n = 10000 and m = 10-1000
If n = small while m is intermediate
	n = 1-1000, m =10-10000
	SVM with  gaussian kernel
if n = small and m is large
	n = 1-1000, m = 50000
	create add/more features
	L.R. or Linear SVM
