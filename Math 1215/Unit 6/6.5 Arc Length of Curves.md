# 6.5 Arc Length of Curves
## Kth-Subinterval
Line segment from $(x_{k-1},f(x_{k-1}))$ to  $(x_{k},f(x_{k}))$
has length $$\LARGE L = \sqrt{(\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y_k)^2}$$
## Arc Length Formula
If the curve y = f(x) has continous first derivatives on $[a,b]$, then the length of y = f(x) on the interval is $[a,b]$ is
$$\LARGE \begin{align} L &= \int_a^b \sqrt{1+(f'(x))^2}dx\\&= \int_c^d \sqrt{1+(g'(y))^2}dy\end{align}$$
