# 6.6 Surface Area
## Volume By Washers
$$\LARGE V = \pi\int_a^b([R_{out}]^2-[R_{in}]^2)dx$$
## Volume By Shells
$$\LARGE \begin{align}&V = \int_a^br(f(x)-g(x))dx\\ &V = 2\pi \int_a^brhdx\end{align}$$
$$\LARGE 2\pi\int_a^bxf(x)dx$$
## Area of a Surface of Revolution
$f$ will be a nonnegative function with continous first derivative on the interval $[a,b]$. The area of the surface formed by rotating the graph of $y = f(x)$ on the interval $[a,b]$ about the x-axis is
$$\LARGE S = 2\pi\int_a^bf(x)\sqrt{1 + (f'(x))^2}dx$$
The area of a fustrum is $A = 2\pi rl$
L being length
R being radius

For the y direction the area of a surface of revolution would be
$$\LARGE S = 2\pi\int_c^dg(y)\sqrt{1 + (g'(y))^2}dy$$
