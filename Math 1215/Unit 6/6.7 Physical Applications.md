# 6.7 Physical Applications
Mass = Density X Volume (uniform density per volume unit)
Mass = Density X Length (uniform density per unit length)

## Mass with Variable Density
Suppose a thin rod represented by the interval $[a,b]$ and has density $\rho$ (expressed in mass per unit length). The total mass of the rod is
$$\LARGE m = \int_a^b\rho(x)dx$$
## Work
Work = Force X Distance
Force = $kg \times m / s^2$ = Newtons
Work = Joules = Newton Meters

## Work done by a variable force
$F(x)$ is a force which varies in magnitude based on the location $x$.
$$\begin{align}\LARGE W &= \LARGE\underset{n\rightarrow\infty}{lim}\sum^n_{i=1}F(x_i)\Delta x\\
&=\LARGE \int_a^bF(x)dx \end{align}$$
## Hooke's Law
The force required to stretch a spring $x$ units from equilibrium is proportional to $x$: 
$$\LARGE F = kx, \hspace{0.25em}k>0$$
k is the spring constant

## Lifting Problems
The work $W$ required to lift a point mass of mass $m$ through a distance $y$ IS
$$\LARGE W = mgD$$
$m$ must be in kilograms, $D$ in meters, and gravity $\approx 9.8\frac{m}{s^2}$

#### Lifting a rope
When lifting a long vertical rope with density $\rho$, we can slice the rope into solices $\Delta y$ located at vertical position $y$, each of which must be lifted a vertical distance $D(y)$ 
The mass of each slice = $\rho\Delta y$ the initial rope must stretch over a -> b
Work to lift a rope:
$$\LARGE W = \int_a^b\rho gD(y)dy$$

## Pumping a problem
When pumping a fluid vertically the mass of each size is 
$$\LARGE m = \rho A(y)\Delta y$$
where $A(y)$ is the cross-sectional area and $\rho$ the density
 $$\LARGE W = \int_a^b\rho gA(y)D(y)dy$$
Work to pump a fluid

## Formula to remember
$$\LARGE \int_a^bmgd$$

## Pressure
Unit of force per area
1 Pa = 1$\frac{n}{m^2}$
$$\begin{align}\LARGE P = \frac{F}{A}=\frac{mg}{A}=\frac{(AD\rho)g}{A}=D\rho g\\\LARGE F = PA = \rho gDA = \rho gD(y)w(y)\Delta y\end{align}$$
This pressure is called hydrostatic pressure

The total hydrostatic force exerted by a fluid with density $\rho$ on a submerged vertical surface with width $w(y)$ located on the interval $a \leq y \leq b$ 
$$\LARGE F =\int_a^b\rho gD(y)w(y)dy$$
D(y) = Depth and w(y) = width
