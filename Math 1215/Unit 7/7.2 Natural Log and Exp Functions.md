# 7.2 Natural Logarithmic and Exponential Functions
## The Natural Logarithm
The natural logarithm of a number $x > 0$ is 
$$\LARGE ln\hspace{0.25 em} x = \int_1^x\frac{1}{t}dt$$
The domain of $ln\hspace{0.25 em}x$ is $(0, \infty)$ and the range of it is $(-\infty,\infty)$
## Integrals Involving logarithms
$$\LARGE\int\frac{1}{x}dx = ln|x|+C$$
## Propeties of Logarithms
$$\frac{d}{dx}ln(x)=\frac{1}{x} (x>0)$$
$$\frac{d}{dx}(ln|x|)=\frac{1}{x} (x \neq 0)$$
## Invertibility of $f(x) = ln(x)$
Since $\frac{d}{dx}ln(x) = \frac{1}{x} > 0$ and always increasing we know $f(x)$ is one-to-one
A function that is one-to-one and continous on its domain is invertible

## Euler's Number
$$\LARGE ln\hspace{0.15 em} e = \int_0^e\frac{1}{t}dt = 1$$
## The inverse of $f(x) = lnx$
$$\begin{align}f(f^{-1}(x)) = x = f^{-1}(f(x))\end{align}$$
$$ln(e^r) = rln(e) = r$$
Thus the derivative of $f(x) = ln(x)$ is $f^{-1}(x) = e^x$
