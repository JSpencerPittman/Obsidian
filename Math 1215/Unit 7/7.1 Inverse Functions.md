# 7.1 Inverse Functions
## One-to-One Functions
A function $f$ is called one-to-one if, for any two values $x_1 \neq x_2$ in the domain of $f$,
$f(x_1) \neq f(x_2)$. 
In other words a function is called one-to-one if no two inputs produce the same output

## Indentifying One-To-One Functions
### Horizontal Line Test
A function is one-to-one if and only if no horizontal line intersects it's graph more than once

### Calculus Techniques
If a function is always increasing or always decreasing then it's one-to-one
Calculus can give us a conclusive method whenever our funciton $f$ is continous, differentiable and $f'(x)$ is never zero.

## Recall: Increase and Decrease
Suppose $f$ is continous and differentiable on an open interval $I$ 
If $f'(x) > 0 \text{ on } I, \text{ then } f \text{ is increasing on } I.$
If $f'(x) < 0 \text{ on } I, \text{ then } f \text{ is decreasing on } I.$

## Inverse Functions
A function f is invertible if and only if it is one-to-one
if $f$ has domain $A$ and range $B$, then its inverse function $f^{-1}$ has a domain $B$ and range $A$
$$\LARGE f(x) = y \Leftrightarrow f^{-1}(y)=x$$
for any x in $A$ and corresponding y in $B$

## Properties of Inverse Functions
If invertible function $f$ has domain $A$ and range $B$ then
$f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ for every $x$ in $A$
$f(f^{-1}(x)) = x$ for every $x$ in $B$

## Finding an Inverse Functions
### Graphically
Reflect the function on y=x to obtain $f^{-1}$

### Symbolically
1.If relevant remove function notation by replacing $f(x)$ with $y$
2.Solve the equation for x in terms of y
3.if variables have no clearly associate meaning, swap x and y and replace y with $f^{-1}(x)$

## Continuity of Inverse Functions
If $f$ is continous on the Interval $I$, then its inverse function $f^{-1}$ is also continous on the corresponding interval consisting of all values $f(x)$ where $x$ is in $I$

## Differentiability of Inverse functions
Let $f$ be differentiable function which is invertible on an interval $I$. if $x_0$ is a point of $I$ at which $f'(x_0) \neq 0$, then the inverse function $f^{-1}$ is differentiable at $y_0 = f(x_0)$. Specifically:
$$\LARGE (f^{-1})'(y_0) = \frac{1}{f'(x_0)}$$
