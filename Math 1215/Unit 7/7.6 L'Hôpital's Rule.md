# 7.6 L'Hôpital's Rule
## Indeterminate Forms
If direct subsitution and/or the basic laws of limits to a funciton results in a form which doesn't uniquley define the limit or even guarantee its existence we are said to have encountered **indeterminate form**

## L'Hôpital's Rule
$f$ and $g$ are both differentiable on an open interval containing $c$ (except possibly at $c$), $g$ is nonzero on the interval except possibly at $c$
$$\LARGE\underset{x\rightarrow c}{lim}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$$
If this produces $\frac{0}{0} or \frac{\infty}{\infty}$ then
$$\LARGE\underset{x\rightarrow c}{lim}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \underset{x\rightarrow c}{lim}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}$$
Same holds for infinity
This also can be displayed in $0\times\infty$ and $\infty- \infty$

## The number e as a limit
$$\LARGE e = \underset{x\rightarrow\infty}{lim}(1+\frac{1}{x})^x=\underset{n\rightarrow 0}{lim}(1+n)^{1/n}$$

## If the indeterminate forms are $0^0, \infty^0,  1^\infty$
1.Begin by writing $y = \underset{x\rightarrow a}{lim}f(x)$
2.Take the natural logarithm of both sides $lny = ln(\underset{x\rightarrow a}{lim}f(x)) = \underset{x\rightarrow a}{lim}ln(f(x))$
3.Evaluate the limit using properties of logs
4.Solve for y
