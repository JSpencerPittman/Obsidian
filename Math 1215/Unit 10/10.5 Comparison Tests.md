Suppose that $\sum a_n$ and $\sum b_n$ are series with positive terms
1. if $0 < a_n \leq b_n$ for all relevant $n$ and if $\sum b_n$ is convergent then $\sum a_n$ is also convergent
2. if $0 < b_n \leq a_n$ for all relavant $n$ and if $\sum b_n$ is divergentm then $\sum a_n$ is also divergent

Suppose that $\sum a_n$ and $\sum b_n$ are series with positive terms
and let 
$$\underset{n\rightarrow\infty}{lim}\frac{a_n}{b_n}=L$$
1. If $0 < L < \infty$ then $\sum a_n$ and $\sum b_n$ either both converge or both diverge
2. If $L = 0$ and $\sum b_n$ converges, then $\sum a_n$ converges
3. If $L=\infty$ and $\sum b_n$ diverges then $\sum a_n$ diverges
