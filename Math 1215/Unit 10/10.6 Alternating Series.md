An alternating series is a series whose terms are alternately positive and negative. Symbolically, an alternating series is of the form 
$$\Large\sum(-1)^na_n\text{ or } \sum(-1)^{n+1}a_n$$
### Alternating Series Test
The alternating series
$$\sum^\infty_{k=1}(-1)^{k+1}a_k,\hspace{0.5 em}a_k>0$$
Converges provided 
1. The terms of the series are nonincreasing in magnitude, $a_{k+1}\leq a_k$ for all $k$ greater than some positive integer $N$ 
2.$\underset{k\rightarrow\infty}{lim}a_k=0$
Member $\underset{k\rightarrow\infty}{lim}a_k=0$ implies convergence for only negative series

## Remainder in Alternating Series
If $S$ is the sum of the convergent alternating series
$$\sum^\infty_{k=1}(-1)^{k+1}a_k$$
Then the remainder $R_n = S - S_n$ satisfies
$|R_n|\leq a_{n+1}$

### Absolute and Conditional Convergence
A series $\sum a_n$ is absolutely convergent if the series of absolute values $\sum|a_n|$ is convergent

A series $\sum a_n$ is conditionally convergent if it is convergent but not absolutely convergent
