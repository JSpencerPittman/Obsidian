# Sequences
A sequence is an ordered list of numbers of the form {$a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n,\dots$}
Alternate forms are {$a_n$} and $\{a_n\}^\infty_{n=2}$ 
Sequences will typically begin with $n=1$ unless directed otherwise

## Explicitly Defined Sequences
Some sequences can be defined by giving an explicit formula for the nth term of the sequence
$$\LARGE a_n=(-1)^n(\frac{n}{n+1})$$
defines $$\LARGE\{-\frac{1}{2},\frac{2}{3},-\frac{3}{4},\frac{4}{5},-\frac{5}{6},\dots\}$$
There's also recursion and fibonacci

## Limit of a sequence
If the terms of a sequence $a_n$ approach a finite value $L$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$ we say the limit
$$\LARGE\underset{n\rightarrow\infty}{lim}a_n=L$$
Otherwise the sequence diverges
If $f(n)=a_n$ for every nonnegative integer $n$ then
$$\LARGE\underset{n\rightarrow \infty}{lim}f(x)=\underset{n\rightarrow\infty}{lim}a_n$$
Provided $lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}f(x)$ exists or is infinite

## Terminology
Increasing if Post > Pre
Decreasing if Post < Pre
Nonincreasing is decreasing with the less than or EQUAL to
Nondecreasing vice versa of above
Monotonic if its nonincreasing or nondecreasing

Bounded above if there exists a number $M$ such that $a_n\leq M$ for all values of $n$ 
Bounded below if there exists a number $N$ such that $a_n\geq N$ for all values of $n$
Bounded sequence if bounded above and below

## Theorem
All bounded monotonic sequences converge

## Geometric Sequences
Have the form $ar^n$ 
Convergent to zero for $|r|<1$ 
Convergent to one for $r = 1$ 
Divergent when $r > 1$ and for $r \leq -1$
