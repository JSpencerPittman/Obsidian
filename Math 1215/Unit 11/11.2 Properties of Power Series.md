A power series has the general form
$$\sum^\infty_{k=0}c_k(x-a)^k=c_0+c_1(x-a)+c_2(x-a)^2+\dots$$
Where $a$ and $c_k$ are real numbers and $x$ is a variable

### Power Series
$$\sum^\infty_{k=0}c_k(x-a)^k$$
The $c_k$'s are coefficents of the power series.
$a$ is the center of the power series.
The set of values $x$ for which the series converges is its interval of convergence. 
The distance from the center $a$ to the endpoint of the interval of convergence is the radius of convergence $R$ 

### Convergence of Power Series
A power series converges in one of three ways

1) The series converges absolutely (and thus converges) for all $x$
	- The Inerval of convergence is $(-\infty,\infty)$
	- $R = \infty$
2) There is a real number $R > 0$ such that the series converges absolutely (and thus converges) for $|x-a| < R$ and diverges for $|x-a|>R$
	- The radius of convergence is $R$ 
3) The series converges only when $x = a$
	- The radius of convergence is $R=0$

### Geometric Power Series
If $|x| < 1$ the geometric power series $\sum^\infty_{n=0}x^n$ converges. Specifically,
$$\Large\sum^\infty_{n=0}x^n=\frac{1}{1-x}$$
The radius of convergence is $R=1$
The interval of convergence is $(-1,1)$ 

### Combining Power Series
If the powerseries $\sum c_kx^k$ converges to $f(x)$ and $\sum d_kx^k$ converges to $g(x)$ on an interval $I$  

1) $\sum (c_k\pm d_k)x^k$ converges to $f(x)\pm g(x)$ on $I$.

2) $x^m\sum c_kx^k=\sum c_kx^{k+m}$ converges to $x^mf(x) provided $x\neq 0$, $m$ is an integer, and $k+m>0$ for all terms of the series

3) If $h(x) = bx^m$ where $m$ is a positive integer and $b$ is a nonzero real number, $\sum c_k(h(x))^k$ converges to $f(h(x))$

### Differentiating Power Series
Suppose the power series $\sum_{k=0}^\infty c_k(x-a)^k$ converges for $|x-a|<R$ and defines a function $f$ on that interval. $f$ is differentiable for $|x-a|<R$; specifically,
$$\Large f'(x)=\sum^\infty_{k=0}kc_k(x-a)^{k-1}$$

### Integrating Power Series
Suppose the power series $\sum^\infty_{k=0}c_k(x-a)^k$ converges for $|x-a|<R$ and defines a function $f$ on that interval. Then $f$ is integrable:
$$\Large\int f(x)dx = \sum^\infty_{k=0}c_k\frac{(x-1)^{k+1}}{k+1}$$
