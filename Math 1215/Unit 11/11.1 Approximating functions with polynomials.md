### Power Series
$$\sum_{k=0}^\infty c_kx^k=c_0+c_1x+c_2x^2$$
Or more generally
$$\sum^\infty_{k=0} c_k(x-a)^k=c_0+c_1(x-a)+c_2(x-a)^2+\cdots$$
$a$ and $c_k$ are constants and $x$ is a variable

### Calculus I : Linear Approximation
Near the point of tangency, the tangent line to $y= f(x)$ provides a good approximation of the original function. The linear approximation to $f(x)$ centered at $a$ is 
$$p_1(x)=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)$$
$$p_1(a)=f(a), \hspace{0.5 em} p_1'(a)=f'(a)$$

### Quadratic Approximation
The quadratic approximation to $f(x)$ centered at a is
$$p_2(x)=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)+\frac{1}{2}f''(a)(x-a)^2$$
$$p_2(a)=f(a), \hspace{0.5 em} p_2'(a)=f'(a), \hspace{0.5 em} p_2''(a) = f''(a)$$

### Polynomial Approximation
If we wish to approximate $f(x)$ near $x = a$ using a polynomial of degree $n$, we need to the approximating polynomial to equal $f(x)$ at center point $a$

Furthermore we need the first $n$ derivatives of the approximating polynomial and the function to agree at $a$ 

### Taylor Polynomials
Let $f$ be a function with $f, f', f'',\dots,f^{(n)}$ defined aat $a$. The nth-order Taylor Polynomial for $f$ centered at $a$ is 
$$p_n(x)=\sum^n_{k=0}\frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k$$
### The remainder in a taylor polynomial
If $p_n$ be the nth-order Taylor polynomial for $f$ 
The remainder in using $p_n$ to approximate $f$ at the point $x$ is
$$\Large R_n(x)=f(x)-p_n(x)$$
The absolute value of the remainder is the error

### Taylor's Theorem
Let $f$ have continous derivatives up to $f^{(n+1)}$ on an open interval $I$ containing $a$. Then for all $x$ in $I$, we can express $f$ as
$$\Large f(x)=p_n(x)+R_n(x)$$
Then where $p_n$ is the nth-order Taylor polynomial for $f$ centered at $a$ and the remainder is
$$\Large R_n(x)=\frac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!}(x-a)^{n+1}$$
For some point $c$ between $a$ and $x$
