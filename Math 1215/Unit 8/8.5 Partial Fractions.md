# Partial Fractions
The method of partial fractions allows us to rewrite a proper rational expression as the sum (or difference) of two or more simpler rational expressions.

### Factoring Polynomials
Every polynomial with real coefficients can be uniquely factored into a product of linear and/or irreducible quadratic force.

1. Distinct Linear Factors
2. Repeated Linear Factors
3. Distinct Irreducible Quadratic Factors
4. Repeated Irreducible Quadratic Factors

## Case 1: Distinct Linear Factors
Consider the proper rational functional
$$R(x)=\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$$ If $Q(X)$ can be factored into distinct linear factors as
$$Q(X)=(a_1x+b_1)(a_2x+b_2)...(a_nx+b_n)$$
$$R(x)=\frac{A_1}{a_1x+b_1}+\cdots+\frac{A_n}{a_nx+b_n}$$
## Case 2: Repeated Linear Factors
Consider the proper rational functional
$$R(x)=\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$$
If $Q(x)$ has a repeated linear factor $(ax+b)^n$ where $n \geq 2$ is an integer, then the partial function fraction decomposition of $R(x)$ will be
$$\frac{A_1}{ax+b}+\frac{A_2}{(ax+b)^2}+\cdots+\frac{A_n}{(ax+b)^n}$$
## Case 3: Irreducible Quadratic Factors
Consider the proper rational functional
$$R(x)=\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$$
If $Q(x)$ has an irreducible quadratic factor $(ax^2+bx+c)$ then use the partial fraction decomposition term of
$$\frac{Ax+B}{ax^2+bx+c}$$
## Case 4: Repeated Irreducible Quadratic Factors
Consider the proper rational functional
$$R(x)=\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$$
If $Q(x)$ has a repeated irreducible quadratic factor $(ax^2+bx+c)^n$ where $n\geq 2$ is an integer then 
$$\frac{A_1x+B_1}{ax^2+bx+c}+\frac{A_2x+B_2}{(ax^2+bx+c)^2}+\cdots+\frac{A_nx+B_n}{(ax^2+bx+c)^n}$$
