# 8.8 Numerical Integration
When analytical methods of integration fail we turn to numerical methods. These method do not produce exact values, instead they produce approximations which are, in general, quite accurate.

## Asbolute And Relative Error
Absolute error of approximation is
$$|C-E|$$
> C is computed numerical solution
> E is exact solution

Relative error of the approximation is
$$\frac{|C-E|}{|E|}$$
## Riemann Sums
$$\LARGE\int_a^bf(x)dx=\sum^n_{i=1}f(x_i)\Delta x$$
Given that $\Delta x=\frac{b-a}{n}$

## Midpoint Rule
If $f$ is defined and integrable over $[a,b]$
The midpoint rule approximation to $\int_a^bf(x)dx$ using n subintervals of equal width $\Delta x=\frac{b-a}{n}$ is
$$\LARGE M(n)=(f(m_1)+f(m_2)+\dots+f(m_n))\Delta x$$
$$\LARGE M(n)=\Delta x\sum_{i=1}^Nf(\frac{x_{i-1}-x_i}{2})$$
$M_i=\frac{1}{2}(x_{i-1}+x_i)$ is the midpoint on the ith subinterval $[x_{i-1},x_i]$ of $[a,b]$ and $x_i = a + i\Delta x$ 

## Trapezoid Rule
$$\LARGE T(n)=(\frac{f(x_0)}{2}+f(x_1)+\dots+f(x_{n-1})+\frac{f(x_n)}{2})\Delta x$$
$$\LARGE T(n)=(\frac{f(x_0)}{2}+\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}f(x_i)+\frac{f(x_n)}{2})\Delta x$$
## Midpoint and Trapezoid Error
The absolute error bounds for both errors are proportional to $(\Delta x)^2$ The error for a given $n$ is the size of the error for the Midpoint rule is half the size of the Trapezoid error. 

## Simpson's Rule
Suppose $f$ is defined and integrable on $[a,b]$ and let $n\geq 2$ be an even integer. The simpson's rule approximation $S(n)$ to $\int_a^bf(x)dx$ using $n$ subintervals of equal width. 
Then the following would be
$$\LARGE (f(x_0)+4f(x_1)+2f(x_2)+4f(x_3)+\cdots+4f(x_{n-1})+f(x_n))\frac{\Delta x}{3}$$
The absolute error associated with simpsons rule is $(\Delta x)^4$
