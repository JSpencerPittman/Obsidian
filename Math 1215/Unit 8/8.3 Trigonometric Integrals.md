# 8.3 Trigonometic Integrals
## Integrals Involving Sine and Cosine
$$\LARGE\int sin^mx\hspace{0.1 em}cos^nx\hspace{0.1 em}dx$$
#### There are three general approaches apply
1. If the integrand can be rewritten so that $du = cosxdx$ remains and everthing else is in terms of $sinx$, we let $u = sinx$
	*Use this when n is odd and positive and m is real*
2. If the intregrand can be rewritten so that $-du=sinxdx$ remains and everything else is in terms of $cosx$ we let $u = cosx$ 
	*Use this when m is odd and positve and n is real*
3. If neither $u=sinx$ or $u = cosx$ work directly use the power reducing identites to rewrite this integrand.
	*Use this when both m and n are even and nonnegative*

## Power Reducing Identities
$$\LARGE sin^2x=\frac{1-cos2x}{2}\hspace{0.75 em}cos^2x=\frac{1+cos2x}{2}$$
$$\LARGE\begin{align}
cos2x&=cos^2x-sin^2x\\
cos2x&=2cos^2x-1\\
cos2x&=1-2sin^2x
\end{align}$$
## Integrals Involving Secant and Tangent
When evaluating integrals of the form
$$\LARGE\int sec^mx\hspace{0.25 em}tan^nxdx$$
Two general approaches apply
1. If the integrand can be rewritten so that $du=sec^2xdx$ reamins and everything else is in terms of $tanx$, we let $u = tanx$
   *This works when m is even and positive and n is real*
2. If the integrand can be rewritten so that $du = secxtanxdx$ remains and everything else is in terms of $sec x$, we let $u = secx$.
	*This works when n is odd and positive and m is real*

## Product-to-Sum identities
To evaluate integrals of the forms
$$\LARGE\begin{align}
&\int sin(mx)cos(nx)dx\\
&\int sin(mx)sin(nx)dx\\
&\int cos(mx)cos(nx)dx\\
\end{align}$$
We can utilize the product sum identities

$$\LARGE\begin{align}
&sinA\hspace{0.2 em}cosB = \frac{1}{2}[sin(A-B)+sin(A+B)]\\
&sinA\hspace{0.2 em}sinB = \frac{1}{2}[cos(A-B)-cos(A+B)]\\
&cosA\hspace{0.2 em}cosB = \frac{1}{2}[cos(A-B)+cos(A+B)]\\
\end{align}$$
