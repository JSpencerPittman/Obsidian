When tracing the motion of a particle in the plane, it's often useful to define both its horizontal and vertical position as functions of time.

In other words we frequently wish to define
$$x=f(t)\text{ and }y=g(t)$$
### Parametric Equations of a line
The equations
$$\Large x=x_o+at\hspace{2 em}y=y_o+bt$$
for $-\infty<t<\infty$ where $x_0,y_0,a,b$ are constants (with $a$ and $b$ not both zero) define a line passing through the point $(x_0,y_0)$

If $a\neq 0$, the line has slope $\frac{b}a$
If $a=0$, the line is vertical

### Tangents of Parametric Curves
Assume $x=f(t)$ and $y=g(t)$ are both differentiable on $a\leq t\leq b$. Then the slope of the tangent line at a point corresponding to $t$ is
$$\Large\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{\frac{dy}{dt}}{\frac{dx}{dt}}=\frac{g'(t)}{f'(t)}$$
provided $f'(0)\neq 0$ 

### Arc Length of a parametric curve
Let $C$ be the curve described by
$x=f(t)\hspace{0.5 em}y=g(t)\hspace{0.5 em}a\leq t\leq b$
where $f'$ and $g'$ are continous on $a\leq t\leq b$
and $C$ is traversed exactly once as $t$ increases from $a$ to $b$.
Then the length of $C$ is
$$L = \int_a^b\sqrt{(f'(t))^2+(g'(t))^2}dt$$
