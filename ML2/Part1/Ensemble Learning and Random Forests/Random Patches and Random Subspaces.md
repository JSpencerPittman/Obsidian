# Random Patches and Random Subspaces
Sampling of features in scikit-learn has two main hyperparameters: max_features and bootstrap_features
Here it's training on subsets of features rather than training sets. Especially useful for high dimensionsal data. 

**Random Patches**
Sampling of both training sets and features.

**Random Subspaces**
Sampling of only features and keeping all training instances
