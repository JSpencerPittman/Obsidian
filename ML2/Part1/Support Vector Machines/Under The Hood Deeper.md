A critical point is where 
$$\LARGE\begin{align}&1.\nabla f(a,b)=\vec{0}\\&2.f_x(a,b) \text{ and/or }f_y(a,b) \text{ doesn't exist}\end{align}$$
$$\LARGE D=D(a,b)=f_{xx}(a,b)f_{yy}(a,b)-[f_{xy}(a,b)]^2$$
If D > 0 and $f_{xx}(a,b) > 0$ then there is a relative minimum
If D > 0 and $f_{xx}(a,b) < 0$ then there is a relative minimum
If D < 0 then the point (a,b) is a saddle point
If D = 0 then the point (a,b) may be any of the above

A region in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is closed if it includes a boundary. A region is open otherwise.
A region in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is bounded if it can be completely contained in a disk or otherwise finite

Extreme Value Theorem:
If $f(x,y)$ is continous in some closed, bounded set $D$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ then there are points in $D$, $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ so that $f(x_1,y_1)$ is the absolute maximum and $f(x_2,y_2)$ is the absolute minimum of the function in $D$.

Finding so called Extrema
1. Find all the critical points of the function in region D and determine function value at each point
2. Find all extrema of the function boundary
3. The largest and smallest values found in the first two steps are absolute extremas
