# Unsupervised Learning Techniques
**Clustering**
Group similar instances into clusters. 

**Anonaly Detection**
Learn what "normal" data looks like, and then detect abnormal instances.

**Density Estimation**
Estimate the *Probability Density Function* of the random process that generated said dataset

**Active Learning**
Train model on the gathered labeled instances and have it make predictions for unlabeled instances
For unconfident instances provide the answers and let it improve
