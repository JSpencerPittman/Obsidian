# Curse of Dimensionality
In a unit square a random point has a 0.4% of being less than 0.001 from a border.
In a 10,000 dimensional unit hypercube it's greater than 99.99999999% away from a border.

The distance between two random points in a unit square is 0.52 while in a unit 3d cube its 0.66 and about 408.25 in a 1,000,000 dimensional cube. High dimensional datasets can be very sparse. This makes new predictions far from other points increasing unreliability.

One theory is to increase the training set size to increase to a sufficent density of training instances, but the required training instances grows exponentially with the number of dimensions.
