# Introduction
*Curse of dimensionality*
More features slow down training and make finding a good solution harder

Reducing dimensionality
does cause loss of performance but speeds up training.

Dataviz benefits greatly from these techniques.

Two main approaches to dimensionality reduction:
Projection and manifold learning

Dimensionality Reduction Techniques:
PCA, Kernel PCA, LLE
